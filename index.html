    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a devoted and driven Full-Stack Software Engineer, I specialize in
      developing innovative and efficient software solutions that drive
      business success. With a strong foundation in both front-end and
      back-end development, I excel in crafting scalable applications
      using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and other
      cutting-edge technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in technology has been marked by a commitment to
      continuous learning and a dedication to excellence. From my early
      days providing technical support and managing e-commerce platforms
      to my current focus on full-stack development, I have always
      prioritized user experience, clean code, and impactful results.
