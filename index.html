    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a devoted and driven Full-Stack Software Engineer, I specialize in
      developing innovative and efficient software solutions that drive
      business success. With a strong foundation in both front-end and
      back-end development, I excel in crafting scalable applications
      using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and other
      cutting-edge technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in technology has been marked by a commitment to
      continuous learning and a dedication to excellence. From my early
      days providing technical support and managing e-commerce platforms
      to my current focus on full-stack development, I have always
      prioritized user experience, clean code, and impactful results.

          Plantivity motivates users by completing their daily self-care tasks and rewarding them with a badge. They assign

        <h3>Snake Web Game JS</h3>
        <p>
          Navigate the snake to eat food, avoid walls and its own body, and achieve the highest score possible. Each piece of
          food
          increases the snake's length, adding to the challenge.

        <h3>Connect 4 Web Game</h3>
        <p>
          Connect Four is a game you play against the computer. Take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The
          first
          to get four of their discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
